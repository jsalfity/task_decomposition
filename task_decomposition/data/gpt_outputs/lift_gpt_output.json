This is indicated by the decreasing distance between the gripper and the cube in the 'gripper_to_cube_pos' column. The robot is moving closer to the cube in preparation for grasping it.\n\n1.2) At step 13, the robot activates the gripper, as indicated by the action column's 7th entry changing from -1.0 to 1.0. This is the moment the robot intends to grasp the cube.\n\n1.3) At step 14, the robot maintains the gripper activation without any movement, likely ensuring a firm grasp on the cube.\n\n2.1) From step 15 to step 20, the robot lifts the cube slightly. This is shown by the 'cube_pos' z-value increasing from 0.82 to 0.85 and the 'robot0_eef_pos' z-value remaining constant, indicating that the robot is holding the cube in the air.\n\n2.2) From step 21 to step 38, the robot holds the cube steady in the air. There are no significant changes in the positions, indicating that the robot is maintaining its hold on the cube without moving it.\n\n2.3) At step 39, the robot deactivates the gripper, as shown by the action column's 7th entry changing back to -1.0. This indicates the end of the episode where the robot releases the cube.\n\nEach subtask captures a major intent change of the robot, from approaching to grasping, lifting, holding, and finally releasing the cube. The subsubtasks within each hierarchy represent the granular motion primitives that make up each major subtask."
