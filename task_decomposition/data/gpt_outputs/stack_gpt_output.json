This is seen in steps 0 to 9, where the robot's end effector position changes in the x and y axes while maintaining a consistent height (z-axis).\n\n1.2: The robot descends towards cube A, which involves lowering the end effector to reach cube A. This is seen in steps 10 to 23, where the z-axis value of the robot's end effector position decreases, indicating a downward movement.\n\n1.3: The robot closes its gripper to grasp cube A. This is seen in steps 24 to 38, where the gripper state changes from -1.0 (open) to 1.0 (closed).\n\n2.1: The robot lifts cube A, which involves raising the end effector while holding cube A. This is seen in steps 39 to 54, where the z-axis value of the robot's end effector position increases, indicating an upward movement.\n\n2.2: The robot moves cube A above cube B, which involves adjusting the position of the end effector so that cube A is directly above cube B. This is seen in steps 55 to 58, where the x and y axes values of the robot's end effector position change to align with cube B's position.\n\n2.3: The robot descends cube A onto cube B, which involves lowering the end effector to place cube A on top of cube B. This is seen in steps 59 to 73, where the z-axis value of the robot's end effector position decreases, indicating a downward movement.\n\n2.4: The robot releases cube A, which involves opening the gripper to let go of cube A. This is seen in steps 74 to 79, where the gripper state changes from 1.0 (closed) to -1.0 (open).\n\nEach subtask represents a distinct intent or goal of the robot, and the steps within each subtask represent the granular actions taken to achieve that goal."
