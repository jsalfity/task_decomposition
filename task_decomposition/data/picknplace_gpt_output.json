    "response": "To decompose the robot episode into hierarchical, granular subtasks, we need to identify the sequential steps that occurred during the episode. We can break down the episode into three main high-level tasks: approaching the can, manipulating the can, and placing the can. Each of these high-level tasks can be further broken down into more granular subtasks.\n\n1. Approaching the Can:\n   - The robot arm moves from its initial position towards the can's position.\n   - This involves adjusting the torque values in the action column to change the robot's end effector position (robot0_eef_pos) closer to the can's position (Can_pos).\n   - The gripper state remains closed (-1.0) during this phase.\n\n2. Manipulating the Can:\n   - Once the robot's end effector is close enough to the can, the gripper state changes to open (1.0) to grasp the can.\n   - The robot arm then adjusts its position to ensure a firm grip on the can.\n   - The robot's end effector position and the can's position should be very close or overlapping, indicating successful grasping.\n\n3. Placing the Can:\n   - After grasping the can, the robot arm moves to a new location to place the can.\n   - This involves changing the torque values again to move the robot's end effector (with the can) to the desired placement location.\n   - The gripper state remains open (1.0) until the can is placed.\n   - Once the can is placed, the gripper state changes back to closed (-1.0), and the robot arm moves away from the can.\n\nThe lowest level primitives are the adjustments in torque values and gripper state at each step, while the highest level primitives are the three main tasks mentioned above.\n\nHere is the subtask decomposition:\n\n```subtask_decomposition = [\n{'start_step': 0, 'end_step': 8, 'subtask': 'Approach Can', 'hierarchy': 1.1},\n{'start_step': 9, 'end_step': 18, 'subtask': 'Adjust for Grasping', 'hierarchy': 1.2},\n{'start_step': 19, 'end_step': 27, 'subtask': 'Grasp Can', 'hierarchy': 2.1},\n{'start_step': 28, 'end_step': 116, 'subtask': 'Move Can to New Location', 'hierarchy': 3.1},\n{'start_step': 117, 'end_step': 119, 'subtask': 'Release Can', 'hierarchy': 3.2}\n]\n```\n\nThe start and end steps are determined by the changes in the action column, particularly the gripper state, and the relative positions of the robot's end effector and the can. The hierarchy levels are assigned based on the level of abstraction, with 1.x being the most abstract and 3.x being the most granular."
