This is broken down into moving the end effector in the z-axis (2.1) while maintaining the gripper state (3.1).\n- The second high-level subtask (1.2) is for the robot to grasp the handle, which occurs from step 7 to 41. This involves moving the end effector in the x and y-axis (2.2) while maintaining the gripper state (3.1).\n- The third high-level subtask (1.3) is for the robot to turn the handle and open the door, which occurs from step 42 to 74. This involves rotating the end effector and applying force (2.3) while maintaining the gripper state (3.1).\n\nThe hierarchy levels indicate the level of abstraction, with 1.x being the most abstract and 3.x being the most granular. Each subtask is sequential and builds upon the previous one to accomplish the overall goal of opening the door."

This can be considered as the robot approaching the door, which is the first major intent change.\n\n- At step 7, there is a significant change in the action values, indicating a new subtask. From steps 7 to 15, the robot's end effector is aligning with the door handle, as indicated by the changes in the 'handle_to_eef_pos' values. This is the second major intent change.\n\n- From steps 16 to 23, the action values indicate an attempt to grasp the door handle, as the robot's end effector position relative to the handle remains relatively stable, but the action values are changing to adjust the grip. This is the third major intent change.\n\n- Steps 24 to 41 show the robot pulling the door handle, as indicated by the consistent negative values in the action's third entry, which suggests a pulling motion. This is the fourth major intent change.\n\n- Finally, from steps 42 to 73, the robot is opening the door. This is indicated by the positive changes in the 'door_pos' values, showing that the door is moving, and the action values suggest a pushing motion. This is the final major intent change.\n\nEach of these steps represents a subtask within the overall task of opening a door, and they are sequential and hierarchical, with each subtask building upon the previous one to achieve the final goal."
